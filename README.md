Cluster analysis using K-means clustering

In this exercise I will do cluster analysis with a machine learning technique called K-means clustering which is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. The provided data set does have player's positions but I will not include them. After I have performed a K-means clustering I will compare the results with the provided data set to see how well the K-means performed.
