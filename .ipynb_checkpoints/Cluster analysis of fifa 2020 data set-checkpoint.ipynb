    "In this exercise soccer players skills will be used to determine their positions by using a machine learning technique called K-means clustering which is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. The algorithm tries to find relationships between the observations which have similair pattern and try to cluster them together. The provided data set do have player's positions but will not include them during clustering, otherwise this exercise is meaningless.\n",

Two distinct clusters could be distinguished from the average skill set which were defender and goalkeeper. The midfielder cluster was not well separeted against defender and striker cluster respectively. One reason can be that players switched between two positions depending on the situation which makes the players skills not as distinct.\n",
    "Lastly, the positions that were determined by the cluster analysis were compared with the positions provided from the data set. 22 of 100 positions of did not match with the provided data. Most of these positions is due to the midfielder skill is not well separeted between striker and defender for some players."
